# What not works
A incomplete list of what is not yet possible with UXP scripting (at the moment) and has already caused me headaches so far. ðŸ¤•
## HTML
- `template` element

## CSS

## JavaScript

- Assign a value to custom property: `Element.style.setProperty('--custom-property', 'value')`
- Get content from template element: `Template.content.cloneNode(true)`
- `setTimeout()` (I think execution is terminated before tasks in the task queue will be executed)
	With a delay of zero, only the first one seems to work:
	```
	setTimeout(() => {
		console.log("Time out finished 1");
	}, 0);
	setTimeout(() => {
		console.log("Time out finished 2");
	}, 0);
	```
- `new DOMParser()` nope (DOMParser is not defined)
